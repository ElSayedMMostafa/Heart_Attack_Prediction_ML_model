# Heart attack prediction ML model with PCA analysis
A ML model to predict if a data record for a patient has a heart attack or not. Within this notebook 4 differnt ML models was tried and tested: Logisitc regression, KNN, Random Forest and SVM. PCA analysis is performed for dimensionality reduction with higher accuracy. 

My main role was to perform data preprocessing, PCA analysis, logistic regression model fitting and testing and random forest model fitting and testing.
